Inspired by stadium tours, house music and indie rock, Graduation marked a departure from the ornate, soul-based sound of West's previous releases as he musically progressed to more anthemic compositions. West incorporated layered synthesizers and dabbled with electronics while sampling from various music genres and altering his approach to rapping. He conveys an ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph directed at listeners. The album prematurely concludes the education theme of West's first two studio albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005), as his aborted \"Good Ass Job\" album would have concluded the concept album's themes <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/Graduation\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

A predominantly baroque pop and trip hop album, Born to Die musically features the same cinematic composition. The lyrics are about love, sex, and drugs, and features prominent references to 1950s and 1960s Americana. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/Born+to+Die\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

Eilish wrote the album with her frequent collaborator, her brother FINNEAS, who produced the album himself. Eilish cited self-reflection during the COVID-19 pandemic as the biggest inspiration for the album. Primarily a downtempo pop record, Happier Than Ever is characterized by sparse, jazz-influenced, electropop arrangements set to meditative tempos, departing from the upbeat, trap-led sound of Eilish's debut album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? (2019). Consisting of torch songs about the downsides of stardom, Happier Than Ever draws heavily from Eilish's rise to fame and the drawbacks that come with it.

It was released on August 20, 2016, exclusively on the iTunes Store and Apple Music along with a CD from the Boys Don't Cry Magazine which features an extra verse on \"Nikes\" by KOHH. Blonde features an abstract and experimental sound in comparison to Ocean's previous releases, encompassing styles such as R&B, pop, soul, avant-garde, indie rock, electronica, psychedelia, and hip-hop. Ocean also notably makes use of pitch shifted vocals.

Musically, Yours Truly is a pop and R&B record, while incorporating 1990s hip hop, 1950s piano pop, and doo-wop music within its production. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that, with the help of Babyface, Grande was able to \"re-create the vibe and feel of the '90s\" with the album.

In its original release, the album was formatted as a double album, intending to market Beyoncé's dichotomous artistic persona. The first disc, I Am..., contains slow and midtempo pop and R&B ballads, while the second, Sasha Fierce (named after Beyoncé's on-stage alter ego), focuses on more uptempo beats that blend electropop and Europop elements. In composing the songs' lyrics, Beyoncé worked with writers, with each session accompanied by live orchestration. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beyonc%C3%A9/I+Am...+Sasha+Fierce\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

The first disc, I Am..., contains slow and midtempo pop and R&B ballads, while the second, Sasha Fierce (named after Beyoncé's on-stage alter ego), focuses on more uptempo beats that blend electropop and Europop elements.

Additionally, the scrapped single \"You Just Haven’t Earned It Yet, Baby\" (which was passed over for \"Shoplifters of the World Unite\") and the near-single \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" (a single candidate from The Queen is Dead that was passed over in favour of \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\") were included. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/The+World+Won%27t+Listen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

NAHWC follows Metro’s debut mixtape, 19 & Boomin, and the four collaborative projects he’s released with other artists since 2016. The title implies Metro’s opinion that producers are under-appreciated in the music industry. The album boasts appearances from Travis Scott, Young Thug, 21 Savage, Swae Lee, Offset, Gunna, Drake, and more. In mid-October 2018, several fake “Missing Person” billboards were posted in New York and Atlanta. Metro posted the album’s tracklist sans features on November 1, 2018. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Metro+Boomin/NOT+ALL+HEROES+WEAR+CAPES+(Deluxe)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

Front man Kurt Cobain sought to make music outside of the restrictive confines of the Seattle grunge scene, drawing influence from groups such as the Pixies and its use of loud/quiet song dynamics. Nevermind was a surprise success by late 1991, largely due to the success of its lead single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\".

This made the album less popular with fans who preferred the traditional rock style they had come to associate with the band. Queen's decision to record a dance-oriented album germinated with the massive success of their 1980 hit \"Another One Bites the Dust\" in the US. \"Under Pressure\", Queen's collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Queen/Hot+Space+(2011+Remaster)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
