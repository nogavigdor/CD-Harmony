Despite early contributions that were later scrapped, Saturday Night Wrist marks the departure of mainstay Deftones producer Terry Date. The band's fifth album was the product of an arduous and stressful creative process lasting roughly two years and straining relationships within Deftones. Complicating matters, and inspiring many of the album's songs, were frontman Chino Moreno's drug addictions and the crumbling of his marriage. The outcome, however, would be an album met with critical praise. This <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Deftones/Saturday+Night+Wrist\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

            "description": "Adele wrote “Send My Love (To Your New Lover)” in collaboration with Max Martin and Shellback for her third album 25. Adele played guitar on the record, and it was this riff that began the song. She told the New York Times: I’ve had that guitar bass line since I was, like, 15. I used to cover ‘Wonderful World’ doing that riff. It sings over it really well. With Max Martin and Shellback, we knocked that out in a day. This is a more upbeat, straight-pop record for Adele, which makes sense considering the super producers behind the sound.

After the project ballooned and became an international success, the group convened for pre-production on their second album in the fall of 1996, and brought in producer Norton to establish a pop sensibility for the tracks.

Many of the songs stray from the band's first two albums because they have a mildly experimental feel.

It was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 1996 Grammy ceremony, but it lost to Dave Grohl's former band Nirvana's album MTV Unplugged In New York. Dave Grohl has often called the Foo Fighters' debut piece to be more of a demo than an album. Nearly all of the album's instrumental parts are performed by Dave Grohl.

Wanting to capture the essence of their earlier work and avoid the artificiality of digital recording, Foo Fighters recorded in the garage of frontman Dave Grohl in Encino, California, using only analog equipment. The sessions were produced by the band alongside Butch Vig, with whom Grohl had worked on Nirvana's Nevermind (1991).

It was released independently through AWAL and her own World in Red label on 30 April 2021, after being delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was primarily produced by the musician herself alongside Matias Tellez, and features additional work from artists such as Finneas O'Connell. Sonically, it is promised to be a more \"ambitious\", \"mature\" and \"developed\" continuation of the musician's previous bedroom pop and indie rock musical style established in the early EPs Chapter 1 (2018) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/girl+in+red/if+i+could+make+it+go+quiet\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
